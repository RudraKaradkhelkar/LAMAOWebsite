  <h1>Banner</h1>
  <p>Judging will be based on a point system. Points will be awarded by judges each using an overall score from 1 to 10, 10 points representing maximum quality and 1 representing minimum quality. Banners will be judged on the criteria of relevance to math, creativity, neatness, and attractiveness, with greater emphasis placed on relevance to mathematics and creativity.</p>
  <p>Due to limited display space, banners which exceed 3 feet by 4 feet by 4 inches (thick) will receive no more than 5 points from each of the judges.</p>
  <p>All banners must be labeled with the name of the school in one of the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The school's name may be part of the banner so that the judges can scrutinize it at a distance of 15 feet and clearly identify which school entered it, or</li>
    <li>The school's name may be on an artistically and/or simply designed label attached to the bottom of the banner so that the judges can read it clearly at 15 feet. The label should not be larger than one square foot in area and will not be considered part of the banner.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All banners must be on a sturdy rod (must be new) with string attached to make the banner hangable and must be registered at the convention registration table upon arrival. Each chapter is responsible for retrieving its banner from the convention headquarters after the dance.</p>

  <h1>Scrapbook</h1>
  <p>Judging will be based on a point system. Points will be awarded by using an overall score from 1 to 10, 10 points representing maximum quality and 1 representing minimum quality. Scrapbooks will be judged on the criteria of relevance to math, thoroughness, neatness, attractiveness, and creativity, with greater emphasis placed on relevance to mathematics events throughout the year and on thoroughness.</p>
  <p>Schools are allowed to bring scrapbooks from former years to display, but only scrapbooks or portions of scrapbooks dealing with chapter activities since the last convention will be judged. All scrapbooks must be registered at the convention registration table upon arrival. Each chapter is responsible for retrieving its own scrapbook from the display area after the dance.</p>
  <p>The maximum dimensions will be 2 feet x 2 feet x 1 foot. The scrapbook must be an actual book with pages that one can turn.</p>
	<h1>T-Shirt</h1>
  <p>Judging for the T-Shirt Competition will be the same as the scoring for the Banner Competition (see above).</p>
  <p>*** Judges of the scrapbook, banner, and t-shirt competitions will include one sponsor or chaperone from every school with an entry. The point systems used are part of the scoring process which in turn will enable a ranking. Sweepstakes points will be based on ranking, not scoring. Banners, scrapbooks, and t-shirts are judged separately; therefore, use of a single theme is not a requirement.</p>
  <p>*** If T-shirt has formulas or math references, they cannot be worn during competition events. If worn, T-shirt must be covered by other outerwear or turned inside out.</p>
  <h1>Poster</h1>
  <p>Each school may enter up to five students to participate in the poster contest during the interschool test. Schools will get the theme for the poster at registration. Poster boards will be distributed at the time of the contest. Each school will enter only one poster. Each participating school must supply their own materials. Nothing may be attached to the poster in any manner (glued, taped, etc.). NO GLITTER (GLITTER PENS, ETC.). NO OPEN CONTAINERS OF PAINT!</p>
